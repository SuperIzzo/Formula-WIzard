# Formula-Wizard
A high-school project of mine.
It is a clever calculator that can transform mathematical expressions.

The source is in terrible condition (it was written by a high-schooler), but the application is still useful and I don't want to lose any of this. I often consider re-starting the project as it can potentially automate a lot of difficult maths if done right.
